Great — below is a full, practical, step-by-step plan for **Option 1 (Web GitHub + Lab PC auto-flash)** plus everything you need to install and configure before you start. I include:

* checklist of software to install (Linux & Windows)
* how to publish `.bin` on GitHub Releases automatically (Actions)
* a robust Python "auto-flash" script that runs on the lab PC and downloads the latest release asset and flashes it
* service examples (systemd for Linux, Scheduled Task / PowerShell for Windows)
* security, robustness and scaling notes
* alternatives (webhooks / push model) and recommended next steps

I wrote this so you can paste it into a README.md for your team.

# Auto-Flash Flow (Big picture)

1. Developers / Students push code to GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions builds the firmware and publishes the compiled `.bin` as a **GitHub Release** asset (or at least as an artifact you can download).
3. The lab PC (connected to many ST boards) runs a small Python service that:

   * Checks GitHub Releases for new firmware (poll or webhook),
   * Downloads the relevant `.bin`,
   * Flashes it to the appropriate board(s) using `STM32_Programmer_CLI` / `st-flash` / `openocd`.
4. Optionally, the service reports back success/failure (e.g. to a dashboard or Slack).

---

# 0. Quick decision / constraints checklist

* Will releases be **public** or **private repo**?

  * Public: downloads do not need auth.
  * Private: lab PC needs a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with `repo` or at least `repo:release` / `read:packages` rights.
* Single board vs many boards:

  * Single board: simple download + flash works.
  * Multi-board: you'll need mapping (which `.bin` -> which board/port) and parallel flashing handling.
* Network:

  * Lab PC must have internet access to GitHub (if using polling).
  * If lab PC is behind NAT and you want push/webhook, you need a publicly reachable endpoint or a relay service.

---

# 1. Software to install (lab PC)

Below I list the typical software you'll need on the lab PC that performs flashing. Choose only what you need.

## Required (minimum)

* **Python 3.8+** (install from python.org or system package manager)
* **pip** (comes with Python)
* `requests` Python package (`pip install requests`)
* **Toolchain/Flasher: one of**

  * **STM32CubeProgrammer (STM32\_Programmer\_CLI)** — official ST tool. Works on Windows & Linux. (recommended if you already use it)
  * **stlink / st-flash** (Open Source) — if you use ST-Link and want `st-flash`.
  * **openocd** (more generic; more complex to script).
* **Git** (optional — for debugging, local repo access)
* Optionally **jq** or other tools for JSON parsing if you use shell scripts.

## Platform specific hints

* **Linux (Ubuntu / Debian)**:

  * `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git curl`
  * Install `stlink` or `openocd` from packages or builds.
  * Install STM32CubeProgrammer from ST website (deb or tar).
* **Windows**:

  * Install Python, ensure `python` and `pip` are in PATH.
  * Install STM32CubeProgrammer (installer).
  * Optionally install `msys2` or have `st-flash` prebuilt; easier to use `STM32_Programmer_CLI` on Windows.

---

# 2. GitHub: publish built .bin automatically (high level)

Your GitHub Actions workflow should:

* Build the firmware
* Produce `.elf` / `.bin`
* Upload that `.bin` as a **Release asset** or create an artifact

**Options for publishing:**

* Upload artifact (actions/upload-artifact\@v4) — artifact is downloadable from the run page (but not shown in Releases).
* Create a Release and attach the `.bin` asset (recommended): use `actions/create-release` + `actions/upload-release-asset` or `ncipollo/release-action`.

**Minimal workflow snippet** (example `.github/workflows/build.yml` using create-release + upload-release-asset):

```yaml
name: Build and Release STM32 firmware
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install toolchain (apt for example)
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi

      - name: Build (example using Make)
        run: make -C . all

      - name: Archive build outputs
        run: ls -la Build && ls -la

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: v${{ github.run_number }}
          release_name: "Auto release ${{ github.run_number }}"
          draft: false
          prerelease: false

      - name: Upload Release Asset
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: Build/${{ github.repository }}.bin
          asset_name: firmware-${{ github.run_number }}.bin
          asset_content_type: application/octet-stream
```

Notes:

* `actions/create-release` + `actions/upload-release-asset` use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically, so normally no extra PAT is required inside the Actions runner (unless repo permissions are restrictive).
* If your repo is private and you want lab PCs to download release assets, lab PCs will need PATs (or allow public read).

# 3. Lab PC: Polling script (Python) — download + flash

This script:

* Checks GitHub Releases via GitHub API for the latest release.
* Downloads `.bin` asset that matches pattern.
* Verifies (optional: check size or checksum).
* Calls flasher tool to program MCU.

Save as `auto_flash.py`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
auto_flash.py
- Polls GitHub releases for new firmware
- Downloads firmware .bin
- Flashes using STM32_Programmer_CLI or st-flash
Configure via environment variables or CLI args.

**Important config notes**

* Set env vars either in the service unit / systemd unit or via Windows environment or a `.env` file.
* `FLASH_COMMAND_TEMPLATE` shown is for STM32CubeProgrammer CLI. Example command:

  ```bash
  STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD -w "Build/stm32_course.bin" 0x08000000 -rst
  ```

  * For `st-flash` use `st-flash write binfile 0x8000000`.
  * For openocd you need a config file and `-c` arguments (more complicated).

# 4. Run the script as a service

## Linux (systemd) example

Create `/etc/systemd/system/auto-flash.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Auto-flash STM32 firmware from GitHub Releases
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=labuser
Environment=GITHUB_OWNER=YourOrg
Environment=GITHUB_REPO=stm32_course
Environment=GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Environment=ASSET_PATTERN=.bin
Environment=DOWNLOAD_FOLDER=/var/lib/auto_flash
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/auto_flash/auto_flash.py
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now auto-flash.service
sudo journalctl -u auto-flash -f
```

## Windows (Task Scheduler) example

* Create a folder `C:\auto_flash`, put `auto_flash.py` and a short PowerShell wrapper `run_auto_flash.ps1`:

`run_auto_flash.ps1`:

```powershell
$env:GITHUB_OWNER="YourOrg"
$env:GITHUB_REPO="stm32_course"
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"
python C:\auto_flash\auto_flash.py
```

* Use Task Scheduler to create a task that runs at startup and repeats every N minutes or run the script as a long-running process with NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) to install as Windows service.

---

# 5. Webhooks vs Polling (which is better?)

* **Polling** (script above): simple, works from behind NAT, no publicly accessible endpoint required. Slight delay (poll interval). Good for small setups.
* **Webhook (push)**: GitHub posts to your endpoint on release creation. Requires public endpoint or relay (ngrok, inbound port forwarding, or a cloud relay).

  * Pros: instant, fewer requests.
  * Cons: need public reachable service or intermediate broker.

**Hybrid approach (recommended for scale):**

* GitHub Action builds & publishes Release.
* Action also sends an authenticated webhook/event to your private infrastructure (a secure broker) that pushes a message to lab PC(s), or puts the .bin into an artifact repository (S3) that lab PC pulls from.
* Or use a message queue (RabbitMQ/Redis) for lab PC subscription.

---

# 6. Security & reliability notes

* **Store PAT securely**: Use OS secret store or environment variables readable only by the service user.
* **Least privilege**: PAT only with read privileges if possible.
* **Verify firmware**: Check checksum or signature of downloaded `.bin` before flashing (prevent flashing corrupted file).
* **Logging**: Record flashing attempts, serial numbers, timestamps, exit codes.
* **Retry/backoff**: If flashing fails, retry with exponential backoff and alert/inform operator.
* **Test on test boards first** before mass-flashing production units.

---

# 7. Scaling to many boards

If you will flash dozens/hundreds of boards:

* Avoid sequential single-thread flashing — parallelize with worker pool.
* Map each physical port to a board id using a config file: `/etc/auto_flash/boards.yml`:

```yaml
boards:
  - port: COM3
    flasher: stm32prog
    pattern: 'groupA'    # maybe choose specific asset with groupA in name
  - port: /dev/ttyUSB0
    flasher: st-flash
    pattern: 'groupB'
```

* Use job queue (Redis/RQ, Celery) to dispatch flash jobs concurrently.
* Provide web UI for status.

---

# 8. Example: end-to-end checklist to implement now

1. **GitHub**

   * Ensure Actions workflow builds `.bin` and publishes it as a Release asset.
   * Test workflow manually and confirm `.bin` appears in Releases.

2. **Lab PC prerequisites**

   * Install Python3 + pip
   * `pip3 install requests`
   * Install `STM32_Programmer_CLI` (or `st-flash`) and verify it runs from CLI (e.g. `STM32_Programmer_CLI --version` or `st-flash --version`).
   * Create `auto_flash.py` (script above). Configure env vars or edit script config.

3. **Test run (manual)**

   * Run `python auto_flash.py once` (or run the script with `once` arg) to simulate one download + flash.
   * Confirm download saved and flashed correctly.

4. **Run as service**

   * Setup systemd or Windows scheduled task to run script on startup.
   * Confirm service logs and that it detects new releases.

5. **Monitor**

   * Add logging to file or central logging server.
   * Test failure scenarios (bad bin, flasher disconnected) to ensure retries/logging works.

# 9. Extra: sample minimal Actions workflow that builds & puts `.bin` into Releases

(Use this if you want a ready YAML to copy; replace `make` with your build commands.)

```yaml
name: Build STM32 and release
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install ARM toolchain
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi

      - name: Build project
        run: make all

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: release-${{ github.run_number }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.run_number }}
          body: 'Automated release generated by CI'
          draft: false
          prerelease: false

      - name: Upload firmware asset to release
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }}
          asset_path: Build/${{ github.repository }}.bin
          asset_name: ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.run_number }}.bin
          asset_content_type: application/octet-stream
```

---

# 10. Next steps I recommend (prioritized)

1. **Confirm your GitHub Actions successfully creates a Release and has `.bin` asset** (do this first).
2. **Pick a flash tool** (STM32\_Programmer\_CLI recommended). Test it manually on the lab PC.
3. **Deploy `auto_flash.py` on the lab PC and run manually once** to download & flash. Fix issues.
4. **Install the script as a systemd service (Linux) or Task Scheduler/NSSM service (Windows)**.
5. For production: add checksums, signature verification, monitoring and a retry policy.
6. If real-time low latency is required, consider replacing polling with **webhook->broker->lab PC** approach.
